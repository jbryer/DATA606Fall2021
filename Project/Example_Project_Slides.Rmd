## 2000 Election 

The 2000 election between George Bush and Al Gore was ultimately decided in Florida. However, there was a third candidate on the ballot, Pat Buchanan, and one county with an unpredictable outcome. Is there evidence that a large number of votes were cast for a mistaken candidate?

The `elections` data frame contains the breakdown of votes by each of the 67 counties in Florida.

```{r}
elections <- read.table("../course_data/2000elections.txt", header=TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source('../course_data/fl_counties.R')
elections$County_Name <- fl.counties
```

There are `r nrow(elections)` counties in Florida that cast at total of `r prettyNum(sum(elections$bush), big.mark = ',')` votes for George Bush and `r prettyNum(sum(elections$gore), ',')` resulting in Bush winning by `r sum(elections$bush) - sum(elections$gore)` votes.

However, in the days following the election there was much controversy surrounding so called "hanging chads." That is, there were a number of ballots where it was not clear who the vote was for. This was a particular issue in Palm Beach. 

## Florida Counties (blue = Gore; red = Bush)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
library(tidyverse)
library(urbnmapr)
elections <- elections %>% 
	mutate(difference = bush - gore,
		   percent_bush = bush / (bush + gore))
fl <- counties %>% filter(state_abbv == 'FL') %>%
	mutate(County_Name = toupper(gsub(' County', '', county_name))) %>%
	left_join(elections, by = 'County_Name')
palm_beach <- fl %>% filter(County_Name == 'PALM BEACH')
ggplot(fl, aes(long, lat, group = group, fill = percent_bush)) + 
	geom_polygon(color = "#ffffff", size = .25) +
	geom_polygon(data = palm_beach, color = 'black', size = 1) +
	scale_fill_gradient2(low = 'blue', high = 'red', mid = 'white', midpoint = 0.5) +
	coord_map() + theme_void() + theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

## Number of votes by county in Florida 

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(bush, buch)) + geom_point() +
	xlab("Number of votes for Bush") + ylab("Number of votes for Buchanan") +
	ggtitle("Number of votes by county in Florida")
```

## Correlation

```{r}
cor.test(elections$buch, elections$bush)
```

## Linear Regression Model

```{r}
model1 <- lm(buch ~ bush, data = elections)
summary(model1)
```


## Residual Analysis 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par.orig <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(log(elections$bush), resid(model1), main="Predictors vs Residuals")
abline(0,0)
plot(fitted(model1), resid(model1),main="Fitted vs Residuals", xlab="Fitted Values")
abline(0,0)
qqnorm(resid(model1), main="QQ-Plot of Residuals")
qqline(resid(model1))
hist(resid(model1), main="Histogram of Residuals")
par(par.orig)
```

## Log Tranform 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(elections, aes(bush, buch)) + geom_point() +
	scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() +
	xlab("Log of number of votes for Bush") + ylab("Log of number of votes for Buchanan") +
	ggtitle("Number of votes by county in Florida")
```

## Correlation with log tranformations

```{r}
cor.test(log(elections$buch), log(elections$bush))
```

## Linear Regression Model (log transform)

```{r}
model2 <- lm(log(buch) ~ log(bush), data = elections)
summary(model2)
```

## Regression model without Palm Beach

```{r}
model3 <- lm(log(buch) ~ log(bush), data = elections[-50,])
summary(model3)
```

## Residual Analysis (log) 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par.orig <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(log(elections$bush[-50]), resid(model3), main="Predictors vs Residuals")
abline(0,0)
plot(fitted(model3), resid(model3), main="Fitted vs Residuals", xlab="Fitted Values")
abline(0,0)
qqnorm(resid(model3), main="QQ-Plot of Residuals")
qqline(resid(model3))
hist(resid(model3), main="Histogram of Residuals")
par(par.orig)
```

## Predict Palm Beach from the model

Obtain the predicted vote count for Palm Beach given the fitted model without

```{r}
new <- data.frame(bush = elections$bush[50])
```

The difference between predicted on the original scale and the observed vote count

```{r}
elections$buch[50] - exp(predict(model3, new))
```

## Predict Palm Beach from the model (cont.)

Prediction Confidence Interval for log(vote count)

```{r}
predict(model3, new, interval='prediction', level=.95)
```

Prediction Confidence Interval on the original scale

```{r}
exp(predict(model3, new, interval='prediction',level=.95))
elections$buch[50]
```

Therefore, what we can say is that it is likely that Palm Beach is a different community.
