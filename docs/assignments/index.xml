      <description>Formative Assessments Formative assessments are a type of assessment that help students and teachers monitor student learning. These are low stakes assessments (i.e. you get credit for doing them, not based upon how you did). I will use the results to inform my instruction.
Part 1 Complete this Google Form. The purpose of this survey is for me to get to know you better. There is no passing or failing, right or wrong answers.</description>

      <description>One Minute Papers A &amp;ldquo;one minute paper&amp;rdquo; (Angelo &amp;amp; Cross, 1993) is a short written reflection to be completed after each class meetup. You are to answer two questions: 1) What was the most important thing you learned during this class? and 2) What important question remains unanswered for you? My goal is to give you a moment to reflect on the most important concepts presented were and to provide me with information about what concepts are still unclear.</description>

      <description>The solutions to the practice problems are at the end of the book and do not need to be handed in. Graded assignments should use the provided R markdown templates provided below. Data for the homework assignments, and for within the chapters too, can be downloaded here. Or alternatively all the data is included in the openintro R packge (use the data(package = &#39;openintro&#39;) command to list all the datasets available in that package).</description>
