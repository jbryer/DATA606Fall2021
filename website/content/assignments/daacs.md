## Formative Assessments

Formative assessments are a type of assessment that help students and teachers *monitor student learning*. These are low stakes assessments (i.e. you get credit for doing them, not based upon how you did). I will use the results to inform my instruction.

### Part 1

Complete this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/FGsUWy61k8A3ujYH9). The purpose of this survey is for me to get to know you better. There is no passing or failing, right or wrong answers. Please answer each section honestly. I will use the results in aggregate to inform the instruction in this class.

### Part 2

The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) is a formative assessment designed to provide you with information about key college skills. DAACS includes assessments in self-regulated learning, mathematics, reading, and writing. **YOU ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING ASSESSMENT**. This should take about 10 minutes to complete the assessment and there is no passing or failing. Once you are done, I encourage you to review the resources recommended to you. We will use the aggregated results in class. To get credit for this assignment:

1. Go to [my.daacs.net](https://my.daacs.net)
2. Create an account. Please use the email address entered in the Google form in Part 1.
3. Complete the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) assessment.

You will receive an email from me through DAACS inviting you to a course within DAACS. Please accept the invitation as this will be how I can verify you completed the assignment.
