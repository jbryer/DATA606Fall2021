Welcome to DATA606! Your instructors will be [Dr. Jason Bryer](https://bryer.org) and Dr. Angela Lui. Couple of important notes as you get started:

* The course syllabus located here: https://fall2021.data606.net/course-overview. We will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments. **Please read the syllabus carefully!** Send us any questions you may still have about the course.
* Complete this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/6V5GrsgvGWFj98hN8) as soon as possible. We will use some of the data (in aggregate) in the meetup.
* [Join the Slack channel by clicking here](https://join.slack.com/t/data606fall2021/shared_invite/zt-tqeu5u6e-qIimBoChX2oyvCJLovewWg). This will be our primary mode of communication. For private communications, you can either send private Slack messages or email us at [jason.bryer@cuny.edu](mailto:jason.bryer@cuny.edu) and [angela.lui@sps.cuny.edu](mailto:angela.lui@sps.cuny.edu).
* Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 1 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudio and will help get you get acquainted with R. See the [software page](/course-overview/software/) for more information about the software we will use for this course.
* The best way to reach us is on Slack. If you would prefer to talk on the phone or setup a Zoom session, it is best to suggest some times by email first.
* Our Meetups will be on Wednesdays from 8:30pm to 9:30pm. **We expect everyone to attend or watch the Meetups.** Important information will be shared during the meetups that will not be available in any other format.
* We am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!
